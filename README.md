# Barista_Bot

This is a barista bot program inspired by NetworkChuck's learning Python series. 

This project is combining all my knowledge that I collected about strings, iterations and so on. Imgaine as this is my portfolio of my Python jorney.

If you want to use this as a learning resource, I am happy for everyone to look at the code.
